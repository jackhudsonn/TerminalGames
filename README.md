# Terminal Games Collection
Welcome to the Terminal Games Collection! This Python and Github project features a collection of classic games and user-invented gamnes that you can enjoy right in your terminal.

## Collaberation <a name="collab"></a>
This is my first GitHub project. As a collaberative learner, my hopes are that newer Github users will find this project and contribute! I have many visions for this project's future: 
1. Build Github skills for myself and the contributers of this project.
2. Give new Github users, including myself, the opportunity to work on an open-source project (great for resumes depending on the complexity of the terminal games)
3. Create a community of unexperienced and experienced programmers that can seek and offer help for debuging games.
4. Potential ability to showcase creative/newly-invented terminal games to a community. 
5. Because there is no automation feature and I am still getting the hang of GitHub's resources, message jackhudsonn or email jwhudson@umass.edu if you are interested in contributing!

## Scalability <a name="scalability"></a>
1. Eventually create a website/application that automates the signup and game creation/editing process, allowing GitHub users to easily update their code, along with having access to create new games for this project.
2. Eventually create social channels.
3. Better file organization techniques as the number of contributers increses
4. Multilanguage support

## Games <a name="games"></a>
This project is currently in it's early stages. As more people contribute, the game library will get larger and larger. Games do NOT have to be complete/bug-free to upload. All that is asked is the game file compiles.

## Have Fun
Enjoy playing the games in the Terminal Games Collection! If you have any questions or encounter any issues, don't hesitate to reach out to us. Happy gaming!
