## Collaberation <a name="collab"></a>
This project is my first real GitHub project! As a collaborative learner, I've decided that there is no better way to learn GitHub's toolbox then by starting my own open-source project that will only get better with time. I invite developers of all skill levels to join; below are the goals and visions for the future of this project:
1. Skill Building: This project serves as a learning platform for both myself and contributors, helping to enhance our GitHub skills.
2. Open Source Opportunity: It provides an opportunity for new GitHub users (including myself) to contribute to an open-source project, which can be a valuable addition to your resume and project portfolio.
3. Community Building: We aim to create a supportive community of both inexperienced and experienced programmers who can collaborate on debugging and improving the games.
4. Showcase Innovation: As the project grows, it can become a platform to showcase creative and newly-invented terminal games to a wider community.
5. Get Involved: Since there's no automated contribution process yet, feel free to private message jackhudsonn or email jwhudson@umass.edu if you're interested in contributing!

## Scalability <a name="scalability"></a>
1. Automated Platform: Eventually, we intend to develop a website or application that simplifies the signup and game creation/editing process for GitHub users. This will enable easy updates to code and allow users to create new games for the project.
2. Social Channels: We're considering the creation of social channels to enhance collaboration and community engagement.
3. Enhanced Organization: As the number of contributors increases, we'll implement better file organization techniques to maintain clarity and orderliness.
4. Multilingual Support: To make the project more inclusive, we aim to add support for multiple programming languages.

## Games <a name="games"></a>
The project is currently in its early stages, and as more people contribute, the library of games will continue to grow. Please note that games do not have to be complete or bug-free to be uploaded; we only ask that the game file compiles.

## Have Fun
Enjoy your time playing the games in the Terminal Games Collection! If you have any questions or encounter any issues, please don't hesitate to reach out to us. Happy gaming!
